# Java Design patterns
Design patterns...
- Are reusable in multiple projects.
- Provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
- Capture the software engineering experiences.
- Provide transparency to the design of an application.
- Are well-proved and testified solutions since they have been built upon the knowledge and experience of expert software developers.
- Don't guarantee an absolute solution to a problem. They provide clarity to the system architecture and the possibility of building a better system.

Design patterns can be divided in:
- [Creational Design Patterns](CreationalDesignPatterns.md)
- [Structural Design Patterns](StructuralDesignPatterns.md)
- [Behavioral Design Patterns](BehavioralDesignPatterns.md)
